2. I would expect tree leafiness to increase with fork percentage. I was right!

                               a

4. It will look like
a
|
\-b
Oh I was wrong! a inherited b's children. Okay. If I use the '-R' flag, then b inherits c's children.
Okay so omitting the '-R' flag means that root takes over the process, which is what I'm used to seeing
on *nix systems.

Action: a forks b
Action: a forks c
Action: b forks d
Action: d EXITS
Action: a forks e

                        Final Process Tree?
a

\-b
\-c
\-e

I was right!

6. Not always - seed '5' is an example where it's ambiguous. A could have forked d directly, or forked
some children that then exited and left 'a' to inherit 'd':
